## Real Time Shared Control and Stage Simulator
This 2012 research focused on developing custom controllers for high-speed shared control, combining joystick input with autonomous collision avoidance. Using the Stage simulator, I demonstrated semi-autonomous control, ensuring non-holonomic robots avoided collisions while maintaining high-speed movement. This project culminated in the publication of a paper titled “The Shared Control Dynamic Window Approach for Non-Holonomic Semi-Autonomous Robots.”
