## [IsaacSim – Wheeled Robot Kinematics Testing](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1suxnatav0icx3rtibpxr/2024-01-11-11-23-45_x_steer_isaacsim.mkv?rlkey=uh4yt35xz8jck777cvf5llr6k&dl=0)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="55%">
      This project explored kinematic control for multi-wheeled robots using IsaacSim. I configured joint controls to achieve precise base movement for various vehicle types. A highlight of this project was managing steering and drive coordination for a complex multi-steering vehicle, pushing IsaacSim's capabilities for dynamic motion across different kinematic configurations.
